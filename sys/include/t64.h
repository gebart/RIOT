/**
 * @defgroup  sys_t64 T64 timer extender
 * @ingroup   sys
 * @brief     Extends a hardware timer to a 64 bit virtual timer.
 *
 * Provides a monotonic 64 bit timer by wrapping a hardware timer, which can be
 * of any width, using checkpointed interval partitioning.
 *
 * ### Theory of operation
 *
 * The hardware timer range is split into multiple equal length intervals called
 * partitions. The hardware timer target is never scheduled further into the
 * future than the length of one partition, this prevents the ambiguity in how
 * the software should interpret read timer values in relation to setting timer
 * targets.
 *
 * An internal state struct is used to keep track of the 64 bit timer target,
 * some internal flags, and the 64 bit offset from the hardware timer.
 *
 * #### Checkpointing
 *
 * A checkpoint is updated every time the hardware timer is read by the library.
 * The 64 bit timer offset is updated whenever the hardware timer transitions
 * into a new partition.
 *
 * #### Long timeouts
 *
 * When a timer target is requested which is further than one partition duration
 * in the future, the t64 wrapper will set successive partition length timeouts
 * on the hardware timer until the target is within one partition from the
 * current time.
 *
 * #### Past targets
 *
 * When a timer target is requested to a time in the past, the callback will be
 * immediately called, without setting a hardware timer.
 *
 * #### Race conditions
 *
 * An extra check is made after setting a hardware timer to ensure that the
 * current time did not pass the timer target while setting the hardware timer.
 * When this occurs, it is impossible for the library to know whether the
 * hardware timer did catch the target or if the time had already passed the
 * target when the hardware timer target was updated.
 * If the library detects that the target was passed while setting the target,
 * the timer target will be cleared and the callback function will be called
 * directly from the T64 library instead of from the timer ISR.
